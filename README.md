Mathematical analysis of dataset. 

## DataSet Information
Since  1973  the  U.S.  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC)
have  conducted  the  National  Survey  of  Family  Growth  (NSFG),  which  is
intended to gather “information on family life, marriage and divorce, preg-
nancy, infertility, use of contraception, and men’s and women’s health.  The
survey results are used ...  to plan health services and health education pro-
grams,  and  to  do  statistical  studies  of  families,  fertility,  and  health.”[See](
http://cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg.htm)

The  NSFG  has  been  conducted  seven  times;  each  deployment  is  called  a 
cycle. We will use data from Cycle 6, which was conducted from January 2002 to March 2003.

1. **2002FemPreg.dat.gz** :  Pregnancy data from Cycle 6 of the NSFG is in a file called
2002FemPreg.dat.gz ; it is a gzip-compressed data file in plain text(ASCII), with fixed
width columns.  Each line in the file is a record that contains data about one pregnancy.

2. **2002FemPreg.dct** : is a Stata dictionary file.  Stata is a statistical software system; a “dictionary” in this
context is a list of variable names, types, and indices that identify where in
each line to find each variable.
